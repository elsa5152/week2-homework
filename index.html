    <p>An “About Me,” also known as a blurb, is a short piece of writing that informs your reader about your professional background, key accomplishments, personal values and any brands you may be associated with. Personal websites, social media profiles and company directories often feature “About Me” sections. A blurb is an opportunity to quickly give important details about yourself to potential business contacts like clients, vendors, employers or anyone who wants to get to know you better.“About Me” writings can vary in length, tone, content and point of view. For example, a social media blurb might be shorter, more informal and written with first-person “I” statements. Blurbs for a company website might include more details, use a professional tone and show your full name. However, you have a lot of freedom in choosing the length and style of your “About Me.”</p>
